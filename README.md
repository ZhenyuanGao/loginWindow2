This project is a shopping platform that contains a login window and the user is able to login and select which ever products is available and being able to purchase it and buy it and it will show up in the shopping cart.

I also designed a backend API with CRUD functionality to update the library when a user being changed (CRUD) or a product selected by the user is bing changed (CRUD) or the shopping list was changed (CRUD).




This project also used ExpressJS, Redux and React Hooks.
